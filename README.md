Sentiment Analysis also known as opinion mining is a technique used to extract emotions from textual information using
natural language processing and text analysis to accurately classify texts as carrying positive, neutral, or negative emotions. In
engagement has grown manifold. Consequently, the volume of opinionated data available on twitter has also grown manifold.
Thus, Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data has become a subject of research in a wide array of fields. In this paper, we will perform
Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data referencing the two presidential candidates, Donald Trump of the Republican Party
and Joe Biden of the Democrat Party, from the one month preceding the 2020 US presidential elections to predict the
